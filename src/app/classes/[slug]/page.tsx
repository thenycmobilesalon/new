/** Per-class "What to Expect" session descriptions */
const classWhatToExpect: Record<string, string[]> = {
  "diy-blowout-workshop": [
    "When our instructor arrives at your location, they will set up a full styling station with professional-grade blow dryers, round brushes in multiple sizes, clips, heat protectant, and finishing products. Each participant gets their own set of tools to work with throughout the session. We start with a brief introduction where the instructor assesses each person's hair type and discusses what kind of blowout will work best for their texture and length. This initial consultation ensures that everyone gets personalized instruction rather than a generic demonstration.",
    "The core of the workshop is hands-on practice. After demonstrating each technique on a volunteer, the instructor guides everyone through the process step by step. You will learn how to properly section your hair, how to hold the round brush at the correct angle for maximum volume and smoothness, how to control tension without causing breakage, and how to use the dryer nozzle to direct airflow for a sleek finish. The instructor moves around the room correcting form, answering questions, and offering tips specific to each person's hair. Expect to practice each section multiple times until the technique clicks.",
    "The session wraps up with finishing techniques, including how to set your blowout with cool air, how to add shine without weighing hair down, and how to sleep on your blowout so it lasts multiple days. Every participant receives a personalized cheat sheet with product recommendations and technique reminders. Most people are surprised by how much better their blowout looks by the end of the session compared to the beginning. The improvement is visible and immediate, and that confidence carries over into every blowout you do at home going forward.",
  ],
  "braiding-basics-class": [
    "Our braiding specialist arrives at your location with mannequin heads, clips, combs, hair elastics, and everything else you need for a productive two-hour session. We start with the absolute fundamentals: how to hold hair, how to create clean sections, and how to maintain even tension throughout a braid. Even if you have braided before, this foundational review helps eliminate bad habits that make braids look messy or fall apart quickly.",
    "From there, we build up progressively through four to five braid styles. The instructor demonstrates each technique slowly, then has everyone practice together with real-time coaching and corrections. You will work on mannequin heads first to build muscle memory, then transition to practicing on each other or on your own hair. The instructor pays close attention to each person's progress and adjusts the pacing so no one feels left behind or bored. By the halfway point, most participants are already completing braids they could never do before.",
    "The final portion of the class focuses on finishing and styling, learning how to secure braids neatly, how to pancake braids for a fuller look, and how to incorporate braids into everyday hairstyles. You will leave with a step-by-step guide for each braid style covered, plus recommendations for the best tools and products to use at home. Many participants tell us this class is the most fun they have had learning a new skill, because there is something deeply satisfying about watching your hands finally do what your brain has been trying to figure out from YouTube tutorials.",
  ],
  "everyday-makeup-masterclass": [
    "Your makeup artist arrives with a full professional kit, including a curated selection of foundations, concealers, brow products, eyeshadows, blushes, and lip colors across a wide range of skin tones. Each participant works on their own face throughout the class, which means you leave looking great and knowing exactly how to recreate the look at home. We start with skin prep, covering the correct way to moisturize and prime so your makeup lasts all day without creasing, fading, or oxidizing.",
    "The main portion of the class walks through each step of a polished everyday routine. Your instructor demonstrates on one participant, then guides everyone through the application together. We cover foundation matching and application (brush, sponge, and fingers, so you know all three methods), concealer placement and blending, brow shaping and filling, a simple eye look using two to three shadows, mascara technique, blush and bronzer placement, and lip options from natural to bold. The instructor helps each person individually, adjusting technique and product choices based on their skin type, face shape, and personal style preferences.",
    "The session ends with a day-to-night transition demonstration, showing you how to take your daytime look and elevate it for evening in under five minutes. Every participant receives a personalized face chart, a visual diagram of their face showing exactly where each product goes, what shades to use, and in what order. This face chart becomes your daily reference until the routine becomes second nature. Most participants tell us they feel more confident applying makeup after ninety minutes with us than after years of watching tutorials online.",
  ],
  "skincare-routine-workshop": [
    "Our licensed esthetician arrives with a portable skin analysis setup, a curated collection of cleansers, exfoliants, serums, moisturizers, and sunscreens, plus ingredient reference materials. The session begins with individual mini skin analyses for each participant. Using professional lighting and a magnifying lens, the esthetician examines each person's skin and identifies their skin type (oily, dry, combination, sensitive, or normal) along with specific concerns like acne, hyperpigmentation, fine lines, dehydration, or redness. This analysis alone is worth the price of the class, as many people have been treating the wrong skin type for years.",
    "With everyone's skin type identified, the esthetician walks the group through building a complete routine step by step. You will learn the correct order of application (it matters more than most people realize), how long to wait between layers, how much product to use, and which ingredients should never be combined. The class covers the five core steps of any effective routine: cleansing, exfoliating (and how often), treating (serums and actives), moisturizing, and protecting with SPF. Along the way, you will test products on your skin so you can feel the difference between textures and formulations.",
    "The workshop wraps up with an ingredient education segment where you learn to read product labels, identify the ingredients that actually work, and spot marketing claims that sound impressive but mean nothing. Every participant receives a personalized routine recommendation listing specific products at multiple price points (drugstore, mid-range, and luxury) so you can build your routine within your budget. You will also learn how to adjust your routine seasonally, because what works in a humid NYC summer is very different from what works in a dry, heated NYC winter.",
  ],
  "group-nail-art-class": [
    "Our nail artist arrives with a complete mobile nail art studio, including polishes in every color, dotting tools, striping brushes, stamping plates, nail tape, glitter, practice tips (fake nails), and everything else you need for a creative two-hour session. We start by setting up individual workstations for each participant and reviewing the basics of nail art: how to hold a brush, how to control polish flow, and how to fix mistakes without starting over. Even if you have never done anything beyond a solid color manicure, you will feel comfortable within the first fifteen minutes.",
    "The core of the class covers three to five nail art designs, progressing from simple to more complex. The instructor demonstrates each design step by step, then guides everyone through recreating it on their practice tips. Expect to learn techniques like dotting (polka dots, flowers, animal prints), striping (geometric patterns, French tips, negative space designs), color blocking, gradient and ombre effects, and at least one advanced freehand design. You practice each design multiple times on fake nails before trying it on your actual nails, so there is zero pressure to get it perfect the first time.",
    "The session ends with each participant creating a finished set of nail art on their own nails or on a display set they can take home. The instructor provides a take-home technique guide with step-by-step instructions for every design covered in class, plus recommendations for affordable tools and polishes you can order online. Many participants are genuinely amazed at what they are able to create by the end of the session. The jump from never having done nail art to confidently executing multiple designs in two hours is dramatic and deeply satisfying.",
  ],
  "mens-grooming-101": [
    "Our grooming specialist, a licensed barber with years of experience, arrives at your location with a full kit including skincare products, beard trimmers, shaping tools, brow grooming equipment, and product samples. The session starts with a straightforward assessment: what is your current routine, what are your biggest grooming frustrations, and what do you want to improve? No one is judged for not knowing anything. Most guys who take this class are starting from zero, and that is exactly who it is designed for.",
    "The hands-on portion covers the full grooming spectrum. For skincare, you will build a simple three-step routine (cleanser, moisturizer, SPF) that takes under three minutes and actually works for your skin type. For beard care, you will learn trimming techniques, how to shape your beard to complement your face shape, and how to maintain a clean neckline between barber visits. The instructor demonstrates each technique, then guides everyone through practicing it themselves. We also cover brow grooming basics, nose and ear hair management, and how to choose products that actually do what they claim.",
    "The class wraps up with personalized grooming plans for each participant. Your instructor will recommend specific products based on your skin type, facial hair pattern, and budget, and give you a simple daily and weekly routine to follow. Most guys are surprised by how little time and effort it actually takes to look significantly more polished. The difference between no grooming routine and a basic grooming routine is dramatic, and it shows up in how people perceive you at work, on dates, and in everyday life. You will leave with the knowledge and confidence to maintain your look every single day.",

                  Every {cls.name.toLowerCase()} session is fully mobile, meaning our instructor travels directly to your location anywhere in New York City. Whether you are hosting in your living room in Brooklyn, a penthouse in Manhattan, a backyard in Queens, or an office in the Bronx, we bring the entire class to you. There is no need to commute, find parking, or coordinate meeting at a studio. Your space becomes the classroom, and our instructor handles everything from setup to cleanup.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What sets our {cls.name.toLowerCase()} apart from generic online tutorials or group classes at a studio is the personalized, hands-on instruction. Our licensed professionals do not just demonstrate techniques and hope you figure it out. They watch you practice, correct your form in real time, and adapt their teaching to your specific needs. This one-on-one attention within a group setting is why our participants consistently report that they learn more in a single session with us than in months of watching YouTube videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have taught this class to thousands of New Yorkers across all five boroughs, from total beginners who have never attempted anything like this before to experienced hobbyists looking to refine their technique. The group dynamic adds an element of fun and camaraderie that makes the learning experience feel less like a class and more like a social event. Many of our bookings are for special occasions like bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations, corporate team-building events, and holiday gatherings, but we also work with groups of friends who simply want to learn something new together.

                    <p>Our blowout workshop covers every aspect of creating a salon-quality blowout at home. You will learn proper sectioning techniques for your specific hair density and length, including how to clip sections so they stay out of the way while you work. The instructor demonstrates correct round brush angles for volume at the root, smoothness through the mid-lengths, and a polished curl at the ends. You will understand the difference between bristle types and barrel sizes and when to use each one.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the mechanics, you will learn the science behind a great blowout: how heat and tension interact with different hair textures, why the direction of airflow matters more than the temperature setting, and how to use products strategically rather than piling them on. We cover heat protectants, volumizers, smoothing serums, and finishing sprays, explaining which ones you actually need and which ones are marketing fluff. By the end, you will have a complete understanding of the blowout process from wet hair to finished style.</p>

                    <p>Our braiding class teaches four to five distinct braid styles, building progressively from simple to complex. You will start with the classic three-strand braid to establish proper hand positioning and tension control, then advance to French braids (adding hair from each side as you go), Dutch braids (the inverted technique that makes braids pop off the head), fishtails (the two-strand technique that looks intricate but is surprisingly simple once you get the rhythm), and rope braids (the twisted style that holds beautifully and works on almost any hair length).</p>
                    <p>For each style, we break down the technique into small, manageable steps. You will learn how to start a braid at different points on the head (center part, side part, crown, nape), how to braid your own hair versus braiding someone else's, and how to finish and secure braids so they last all day. We also cover styling variations: how to pancake braids for a fuller, more textured look, how to incorporate braids into updos and half-up styles, and how to braid with different hair textures and lengths.</p>

                    <p>Our everyday makeup masterclass covers the complete spectrum of daily makeup application. You will learn skin prep (the step most people skip that makes the biggest difference), how to find your exact foundation shade and apply it seamlessly, concealer techniques for under-eyes, blemishes, and redness, brow shaping and filling methods that look natural rather than drawn-on, and a simple two-to-three shadow eye look that works for every occasion.</p>
                    <p>We also cover blush and bronzer placement based on your face shape, mascara application techniques that prevent clumping and smudging, and lip options from barely-there tints to bold statement colors. Our instructor teaches you three different foundation application methods (brush, sponge, and fingers) so you can choose the one that gives you the best result. You will also learn the day-to-night transition: how to take your daytime look and elevate it for evening in under five minutes with just two or three additional products.</p>

                    <p>Our skincare workshop covers the five core pillars of an effective routine: cleansing, exfoliating, treating, moisturizing, and sun protection. For each step, you will learn why it matters, which product types and formulations are best for your skin type, how to apply them correctly (yes, there is a right and wrong way to apply moisturizer), and how to layer multiple products without pilling or irritation.</p>
                    <p>The ingredient education component is where this class really shines. You will learn what retinol, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and vitamin C actually do at a cellular level, which concentrations are effective, and which ingredient combinations to avoid. We teach you to read ingredient labels so you can evaluate any product on the shelf, compare it to alternatives, and make an informed purchasing decision. This knowledge saves you hundreds of dollars over time by preventing impulse buys on products that sound good but do nothing for your skin.</p>

                    <p>Our nail art class covers both foundational techniques and specific designs. On the technique side, you will learn proper brush control (how to hold a detail brush, how to load it with polish, how to create clean lines), dotting techniques using both professional dotting tools and household items, striping and taping methods for geometric designs, and gradient and ombre application. These foundational skills are transferable to any design you want to create in the future.</p>
                    <p>On the design side, you will learn three to five complete nail art looks, which typically include polka dot and dotting patterns, geometric or striped designs, a floral or nature-inspired design, a gradient or ombre effect, and at least one advanced freehand design. Our instructor breaks each design into numbered steps so even someone who has never done nail art can follow along and create a beautiful result. You practice every design on fake nails first, so there is zero pressure and you can experiment freely.</p>

On the skincare side, you will learn how to identify your skin type (most guys have no idea), how to choose a cleanser that works without over-drying, the importance of moisturizer even for oily skin, and why SPF is the single most effective anti-aging product on the market. We build you a three-step routine that takes under three minutes.</p>
                    <p>For beard and facial hair, you will learn trimming techniques using both guards and freehand, how to shape your beard to complement your face shape, how to maintain a clean neckline between barber visits, and how to deal with common issues like patchiness, ingrown hairs, and uneven growth. We also cover brow grooming (cleaning up the middle and shaping without over-plucking), nose and ear hair management, and product recommendations for every step of your routine, from affordable drugstore options to premium products that are worth the investment.</p>

                    <p>This workshop is designed for anyone in New York City who wants to stop relying on salon blowouts and start doing their own hair with professional results. If you currently spend $65 to $95 per blowout at a salon and go once a week or even once every two weeks, you are spending thousands of dollars a year on something you could learn to do yourself. Our class pays for itself after your first or second at-home blowout.</p>
                    <p>It is also perfect for people who have tried to blow out their own hair at home and been frustrated by the results. If your blowouts come out frizzy, flat, or lopsided, it is almost certainly a technique issue rather than a hair issue, and that is exactly what our instructors correct. We see breakthrough moments in every single class where someone who thought they just had bad hair realizes they were holding the brush wrong the entire time.</p>

It is ideal for bridesmaids and bridal parties who want to bond over learning a new skill together while potentially saving on wedding-day hair costs. And it is great for anyone who has always admired braided hairstyles and wanted to learn how to create them.</p>
                    <p>We welcome all ages and experience levels. Whether you are a teenager who wants to braid your own hair for school, a college student planning a creative girls' night, or a grandmother who wants to learn new styles for your grandchildren, this class meets you where you are and takes your skills to the next level.</p>

If you stand in front of the mirror not knowing where to start, or if you own thirty products but only use three of them, this class is for you. We cut through the noise and teach you only what matters for your face, your skin, and your lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>It is also ideal for people going through transitions: starting a new job, re-entering the dating scene, preparing for a major event, or simply wanting to feel more polished and confident in their daily appearance. We frequently teach this class to bridal parties, corporate teams, college graduates, and friend groups who want to have fun while learning something genuinely useful.</p>

If you have spent hundreds of dollars on serums and creams that promised miracles and delivered nothing, this class will show you why and help you start over with a routine that is built on science rather than marketing.</p>
                    <p>It is especially valuable for people dealing with specific skin concerns like acne, aging, hyperpigmentation, redness, sensitivity, or chronic dryness. Our esthetician addresses each person's unique concerns individually and recommends targeted solutions. We also frequently host this workshop for bridal parties (great skin starts months before the wedding), corporate wellness events, and friend groups who want to invest in their skin together.</p>

                    <p>We designed this class specifically for men who are starting from scratch or near-scratch. There is no expectation that you know anything about skincare, grooming products, or facial hair maintenance coming in. Our instructor is a licensed barber who works with guys every day and understands that most men want simple, effective solutions, not complicated 12-step routines. If you can brush your teeth, you can follow the routine we build for you.</p>
