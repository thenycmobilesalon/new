const classFaqs = [
  {
    q: "How much do beauty classes cost?",
    a: "All of our mobile beauty classes and workshops are priced at $99 per hour with a two-hour minimum for groups of three or more. This flat hourly rate covers everything — the instructor, all tools, all products, all materials, and travel to your location anywhere in the five boroughs. There are no hidden fees, no per-person surcharges, and no extra charges for supplies. For private one-on-one lessons, pricing varies slightly depending on the workshop type, so contact us for a custom quote. Compared to what you would pay at a beauty school or workshop studio in Manhattan, our mobile classes deliver far more value because you get personalized attention in a comfortable setting without commuting anywhere.",
  },
  {
    q: "What skill level do I need for the classes?",
    a: "Absolutely no experience is required for any of our workshops. Every class we teach is designed to accommodate complete beginners as well as intermediate students who want to refine their technique. Our instructors start with the fundamentals and build from there, adapting the pace and depth of instruction to the group in real time. If someone in your group has never held a round brush or blending sponge before, that is completely fine. If someone else has been doing their own makeup for years and wants to learn professional tricks, they will get value too. We frequently teach mixed-skill groups — bridal parties where some attendees are beauty enthusiasts and others have never braided hair — and our instructors know how to keep everyone engaged and learning at their own level.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many people can attend a class?",
    a: "Our workshops are designed for small groups, typically ranging from 3 to 12 participants depending on the class type. Hair classes like the DIY Blowout Workshop and Braiding Basics work best with 4 to 10 people so the instructor can provide hands-on corrections to each participant. Makeup and skincare workshops can accommodate up to 10 to 12 people comfortably. Nail art classes work best with 4 to 8 people given the detail-oriented nature of the work. For larger groups — corporate events, big bridal parties, birthday celebrations with 15 or more guests — we bring additional instructors to maintain the small-group ratio that makes our classes effective. Contact us to discuss your group size and we will build a custom plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do the classes take place?",
    a: "Anywhere you want in New York City. That is the entire point of a mobile beauty class — we come to you. We have taught workshops in living rooms in Brooklyn, penthouses in Manhattan, hotel suites in Midtown, Airbnbs in Queens, offices in the Financial District, backyards in the Bronx, and beach houses on Staten Island. All we need is enough space for your group to sit comfortably with a bit of elbow room and access to a bathroom with running water. We bring all the tools, products, mirrors, and materials. You provide the space and the people. If you are unsure whether your space works, send us photos and we will let you know.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I need to provide?",
    a: "Just the space and the people. We bring absolutely everything else — all professional tools, all products, all materials, mirrors, capes, practice supplies, handouts, and take-home guides. For makeup and skincare classes, participants should come with clean, bare skin so they can work on their own faces during the workshop. For hair classes, participants should come with clean, dry hair (or slightly damp, depending on the workshop — we will let you know when you book). For nail art classes, we provide practice tips (fake nails) so participants can experiment freely. If you want to serve drinks, snacks, or make it a party, that is entirely up to you — many of our clients turn the class into a full event with food and cocktails.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book a private one-on-one lesson?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely. Private lessons are available for all six of our workshop types. A one-on-one session gives you the full, undivided attention of a licensed professional who can tailor every minute of instruction to your specific needs, skill level, hair type, skin concerns, or goals. Private lessons are especially popular for brides who want personalized blowout or makeup training before their wedding, professionals who want to refine their daily routine, and men who want a comfortable, no-pressure environment to learn grooming basics. Contact us for private lesson pricing — rates vary by workshop type and are slightly higher than the group rate to reflect the personalized instruction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are materials and supplies included?",
    a: "Yes, every single thing you need is included. We bring professional-grade tools, high-quality products, practice materials, mirrors, capes, and anything else required for the class. For braiding classes, we bring practice hair and mannequin heads. For nail art classes, we bring practice tips, polishes, art tools, and design templates. For skincare workshops, we bring product samples for testing. Every participant also receives a take-home guide — a printed or digital reference sheet with step-by-step instructions for everything covered in the class, plus product recommendations tailored to their needs. You never need to buy, bring, or prepare anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer corporate and team-building classes?",
    a: "Corporate workshops are one of our most popular bookings. Our beauty and grooming classes make exceptional team-building activities, wellness day programming, employee appreciation events, and client entertainment experiences. We have worked with companies across every industry — tech startups in SoHo, law firms in Midtown, media companies in Hudson Yards, and agencies in DUMBO. The classes are interactive, social, and genuinely fun in a way that most corporate team-building activities are not. Participants leave with real skills they will actually use. We can customize the workshop content, duration, and format to fit your company's goals and budget. We also provide branded materials and can coordinate with your events team on logistics. Contact us to discuss corporate packages.",
  },
  {
    q: "What ages are appropriate for your classes?",
    a: "Our classes are appropriate for teens and adults of all ages. We regularly teach participants ranging from 13 to 70-plus years old. For younger teens (13 to 15), we recommend the nail art class, braiding basics, or skincare routine workshop as great starting points — these are especially popular for birthday parties and mother-daughter bonding sessions. The makeup masterclass is suitable for ages 16 and up. The men's grooming workshop is designed for adults but works well for teens 16 and older who are starting to develop a grooming routine. We have no upper age limit and love teaching participants who are discovering beauty skills for the first time later in life. If you are booking for a group with a wide age range, let us know and we will tailor the content accordingly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need any experience?",
    a: "No experience is needed for any of our classes. Every workshop is built from the ground up to be accessible to total beginners while still offering depth and value for people with some existing knowledge. Our instructors are trained to teach, not just perform — they break down every technique into clear, manageable steps and provide hands-on corrections so you build muscle memory, not just theoretical understanding. Many of our students tell us they learned more in a single two-hour class than they did from months of watching YouTube tutorials, because there is simply no substitute for a licensed professional watching you practice and giving you real-time feedback on what to adjust.",

              The NYC Mobile Salon does not just do beauty services — we teach them too. Our mobile beauty classes bring licensed, working professionals directly to your living room, office, hotel suite, or any space in New York City where your group can gather comfortably. We offer six distinct workshops covering the full spectrum of beauty and grooming skills: a <Link href="/classes/diy-blowout-workshop" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">DIY Blowout Workshop</Link> that teaches you salon-quality styling technique, a <Link href="/classes/braiding-basics-class" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Braiding Basics Class</Link> covering French braids, Dutch braids, fishtails and more, an <Link href="/classes/everyday-makeup-masterclass" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Everyday Makeup Masterclass</Link> for building a polished daily routine, a <Link href="/classes/skincare-routine-workshop" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Skincare Routine Workshop</Link> led by licensed estheticians, a <Link href="/classes/group-nail-art-class" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Group Nail Art Class</Link> that teaches real nail artist techniques, and a <Link href="/classes/mens-grooming-101" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Men&apos;s Grooming 101</Link> session covering skincare, beard care, and daily grooming fundamentals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every class is priced at $99 per hour with a two-hour minimum for groups of three or more. That flat rate covers everything — the instructor, all professional tools, all products, all materials, and travel to your location anywhere in the five boroughs. There are no hidden fees, no per-person add-ons, and no supplies to buy in advance. We bring it all. You provide the space and the people, and we handle the rest. It is genuinely that simple. Most groups book a two-hour session, but you can extend to three or four hours if you want to cover more ground or combine elements from multiple workshops.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes our approach to beauty education fundamentally different from watching tutorials on YouTube or scrolling through Instagram reels is the hands-on, real-time feedback loop. You are not passively watching a demonstration and hoping you can replicate it later on your own. You are actively practicing each technique under the direct supervision of a licensed professional who watches your hands, corrects your form, adjusts your angle, and gives you specific, personalized feedback that no video can ever provide. That is the difference between understanding a technique intellectually and actually being able to do it. Our students consistently tell us they learned more in a single two-hour workshop than in months of self-guided practice, because a professional can spot and correct the tiny mistakes that hold you back — mistakes you cannot see in yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our instructors are not beauty influencers or hobbyists. They are licensed, insured professionals who work full-time in the beauty industry. Our hairstylists work in top NYC salons. Our makeup artists work on editorial shoots, weddings, and fashion shows. Our estheticians hold state licenses and continuing education certifications. Our nail artists work in high-end nail studios. Our barbers and grooming specialists work in established barbershops across the city. They teach because they love sharing their craft, and because they are genuinely skilled at breaking down professional techniques into learnable steps for non-professionals. Teaching is a skill in itself, and we select our instructors for both their professional ability and their ability to communicate and connect with students.

              Whether you are planning a girls&apos; night in Williamsburg, a bridal party workshop in Manhattan, a corporate team-building event in Midtown, a mother-daughter bonding session in Park Slope, a birthday celebration in Astoria, or you simply want to invest in your own skills with a private lesson — we have a class for you. Our workshops are designed to be social, engaging, and genuinely fun while delivering real, lasting skills that participants use long after the class ends. Most groups pair the workshop with drinks, snacks, and music to create a full experience, and we love that energy. Learning beauty skills should be fun, not intimidating.

                      Hair is the foundation of how most people present themselves to the world, yet the vast majority of us never received any formal training in how to style our own hair. We rely on salon visits for anything beyond a basic ponytail, spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year on blowouts and styling that we could learn to do ourselves with the right instruction. Our hair workshops change that equation entirely. Whether you want to master the art of the salon-quality blowout or learn to create beautiful braided styles for yourself, your friends, or your children, our licensed hairstylists break down professional techniques into clear, repeatable steps that anyone can learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our hair classes are designed for all hair types and textures — fine, thick, curly, coily, wavy, and straight. Our instructors are experienced with the full range of hair types that New York City&apos;s diverse population brings, and they adapt their teaching to each participant&apos;s specific texture, length, and styling goals. The blowout workshop focuses on round brush technique, sectioning, tension control, and finishing, while the braiding class covers French braids, Dutch braids, fishtails, rope braids, and creative variations. Both classes include take-home guides with step-by-step instructions so you can practice and refine your skills after the workshop ends.

                      Makeup is one of those skills that looks simple when a professional does it but feels overwhelming when you stand in front of your own mirror with a drawer full of products you are not sure how to use. The sheer volume of makeup content online — much of it contradictory, trend-driven, or created by people selling products — makes it harder, not easier, to figure out what actually works for your face. Our Everyday Makeup Masterclass cuts through the noise and teaches you the timeless fundamentals that professional makeup artists use every day: skin prep, foundation matching and application, concealer technique, brow shaping, eye basics, blush placement, and lip options.

                      This is not a class about dramatic, Instagram-worthy full glam. It is a practical workshop about building a quick, polished, everyday routine that takes 10 to 15 minutes and makes you look like the best version of yourself. You work on your own face throughout the class with a professional makeup artist guiding you step by step, correcting your technique, and helping you find the right products for your skin type, tone, and lifestyle. Every participant leaves with a personalized face chart showing exactly what products go where on their specific face. It is the kind of individualized instruction that would cost hundreds of dollars in a private consultation.

                      The skincare industry generates billions of dollars by making routines seem complicated and selling you more products than you need. Our Skincare Routine Workshop, taught by licensed estheticians, strips away the marketing and teaches you the science-backed fundamentals of effective skincare: how to read your skin, how to choose products that actually work for your concerns, and how to build a simple, sustainable routine that delivers real results. Every participant receives a mini skin analysis at the start of the workshop, so the instruction is immediately relevant to their specific skin type and concerns.

                      We cover the core steps — cleansing, exfoliating, treating, moisturizing, and protecting — along with ingredient education that teaches you what retinol, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and other popular actives actually do, who they are right for, and how to layer them correctly. You will learn to read ingredient labels, identify marketing hype, and stop wasting money on products that are wrong for your skin. Whether you are dealing with acne, aging, hyperpigmentation, sensitivity, dryness, or oiliness, our estheticians have seen it all and can guide you toward a routine that works.

                      Nail art has exploded in popularity over the past decade, transforming from a niche hobby into a mainstream form of self-expression. But the gap between the stunning designs you see on social media and what you can actually create at home with no training can feel impossibly wide. Our Group Nail Art Class bridges that gap by teaching you the real techniques, tools, and tricks that professional nail artists use — starting with the basics and building up to designs that look genuinely impressive. You will learn dotting, striping, color blocking, gradient effects, florals, geometric patterns, and freehand art, all with guidance and real-time feedback from a working nail artist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the best parts of our nail art class is that we provide practice tips — fake nails — so you can experiment freely without worrying about messing up your own manicure. This removes the pressure and lets you focus entirely on learning technique. By the end of the two-hour session, you will have mastered three to five new designs that you can recreate at home, and you will understand the fundamentals well enough to start creating your own original designs. This workshop is one of our most popular for birthday parties, bachelorette parties, and girls&apos; nights because it is inherently social and creative.

                      Most men never received any formal grooming education. The skincare routine, beard maintenance, brow cleanup, and daily grooming habits that make someone look polished and put-together are skills that are rarely taught in any structured way. Our Men&apos;s Grooming 101 workshop fills that gap with practical, no-nonsense instruction from licensed barbers and grooming specialists who work with men every day. This is not about vanity or trends — it is about learning the fundamental daily habits that make a real, visible difference in how you look and feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The workshop covers building a skincare routine that takes three minutes, beard trimming and shaping techniques, maintaining a clean neckline between barber visits, brow grooming basics, and product recommendations that actually work without requiring a 12-step routine. Every participant leaves with a personalized grooming plan tailored to their face shape, skin type, and lifestyle. This class is especially popular for grooms preparing for their wedding, groomsmen groups, and corporate teams looking for a unique, practical team-building experience that guys will actually enjoy.
