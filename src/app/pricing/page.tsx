    url: "https://thenycmobilesalon.com/pricing",
  },
};

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Why does The NYC Mobile Salon charge $99 per hour?",
    a: "Our $99/hour rate covers a licensed, vetted beauty professional who travels to your location with all the tools, products, and materials needed for your service. There are no additional charges for travel, setup, or cleanup. When you factor in the cost of commuting to a salon, tipping, parking or transit fares, and the value of your own time, our all-inclusive rate often comes out the same or less than a traditional salon visit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a minimum booking time?",
    a: "Yes. For individual appointments, there is a 1-hour minimum. For group bookings of 3 or more people — including events, classes, and parties — there is a 2-hour minimum. This ensures our stylists can dedicate proper time and attention to every client.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any hidden fees or extra charges?",
    a: "Absolutely not. The $99/hour rate is fully all-inclusive. There are no travel fees, no product upcharges, no setup or cleanup fees, and no surge pricing. The price you see is the price you pay, every time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is travel included in the price?",
    a: "Yes — travel is completely free to any location in all five NYC boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Our stylists come to your apartment, office, hotel, event space, or wherever you need them. No mileage fees, no distance surcharges.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to tip my stylist?",
    a: "Tipping is never required or expected. Our $99/hour rate is designed to be fair and sustainable for both our clients and our stylists. That said, if you feel your stylist went above and beyond, tips are always appreciated but entirely optional.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does pricing work for events and group bookings?",
    a: "Events and group bookings follow the same $99/hour rate with a 2-hour minimum for groups of 3 or more people. For larger events like bridal parties, corporate gatherings, or birthday celebrations, we can assign multiple stylists to work simultaneously so everyone gets their services done efficiently. Contact us to plan your event.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do group rates work if I have more than 3 people?",
    a: "The rate stays the same — $99/hour per stylist. For larger groups, we send additional stylists so everyone can be served within a reasonable timeframe. For example, a bridal party of 6 getting hair and makeup might have 2-3 stylists working at the same time. We'll help you figure out the best setup when you book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book multiple services in one appointment?",
    a: "Absolutely. Many clients book a blowout and a manicure, or a haircut followed by a beard trim. You simply pay for the total time used. If a blowout takes 45 minutes and a gel manicure takes another 45 minutes, that's a 1.5-hour appointment at $99/hour. We'll estimate the total time when you book so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    q: "What forms of payment do you accept?",
    a: "We accept Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, Apple Pay, and cash. We keep it simple and flexible — no credit card processing fees, no invoicing headaches.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    a: "You can cancel or reschedule for free up to 12 hours before your appointment. Cancellations with less than 12 hours notice may be subject to a fee. For events and group bookings, we ask for at least 48 hours notice due to the number of stylists involved.",
  },

          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            <p>
              At The NYC Mobile Salon, every service we offer is billed at the same straightforward rate: <strong className="text-gray-900">$99 per hour</strong>. Whether you are booking a blowout, a full color transformation, a gel manicure, a men&apos;s fade, a bridal updo, or a 10-person corporate wellness event, the rate is the same. We believe pricing should be easy to understand and impossible to be surprised by, so we built our entire business around a single, honest number.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why hourly instead of per-service? Because beauty is personal. A blowout on shoulder-length hair takes less time than a blowout on waist-length hair. A simple haircut is faster than a detailed fade with a lineup. Rather than inflating prices to cover edge cases, we charge for the actual time your stylist spends with you. This keeps costs fair for everyone — whether your appointment runs 45 minutes or two and a half hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our $99/hour rate is fully all-inclusive. That means your stylist&apos;s travel time to your location is on us — no matter which borough you are in. It means all tools, equipment, professional-grade products, and materials are included. It means setup and cleanup at your location are covered. There are no product upcharges, no weekend surcharges, no peak-hour fees, and no surprise add-ons on your bill. The price you are quoted is the price you pay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipping is never required or expected. We designed our rate to be fair and sustainable for both our clients and our stylists. If you feel your stylist went above and beyond, a tip is always appreciated — but it is entirely your choice, not an obligation. We want you to focus on enjoying your service, not doing math at the end of your appointment.

            Since we charge by the hour, it helps to know approximately how long your service will take. These are general estimates — your stylist will give you a more precise timeframe when you book. Actual times may vary based on hair length, texture, and the complexity of your request.

              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
                Instead of booking separate appointments for a haircut and a blowout, or a manicure and a pedicure, combine them into a single visit. You save time and your stylist is already there — no additional travel or setup needed. Many clients book a blowout, manicure, and brow wax in one session and are done in under two hours.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
                Getting ready with friends, roommates, or coworkers? Group bookings are one of the best ways to maximize value. While one person gets their hair done, another can be getting a manicure from a second stylist. You split the collective time and everyone gets pampered. The 2-hour minimum for groups of 3+ is easily filled when multiple people are getting services.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
                When you book consistently with the same stylist, they learn your preferences, your hair or skin type, and exactly how you like things done. This means less time explaining, faster service, and better results. Regular clients often find their appointments become more efficient over time, which means less billable time for the same great outcome.

              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
                Having reference photos, a clear idea of the look you want, and a clean workspace ready to go can shave valuable minutes off your appointment. Less deliberation time means a shorter appointment, which means a lower bill. Preparation is the easiest way to keep costs down.

            A $65 blowout at a Manhattan salon seems cheaper than our $99/hour rate on paper. But when you factor in the true cost of a salon visit, the numbers tell a different story. Here is what a typical salon appointment actually costs when you account for everything.
