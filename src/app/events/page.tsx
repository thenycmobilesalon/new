const eventFaqs = [
  {
    q: "How far in advance should I book an event?",
    a: "We recommend booking at least 2-4 weeks ahead for small events like birthday parties or girls' night in, and 2-3 months for weddings, large corporate events, or anything during peak season (May through October). The earlier you reach out, the more flexibility we have with scheduling and staffing. That said, we do accommodate last-minute bookings when our calendar allows — reach out and we'll do our best to make it work on short notice.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many stylists will come to my event?",
    a: "We scale our team to match your group size, timeline, and the complexity of services requested. For a party of 6-8 getting blowouts and makeup, we typically send 2-3 professionals working simultaneously so everyone is ready within a couple of hours. For weddings and large celebrations with 15+ people, we deploy full teams of 4-6+ stylists and makeup artists who coordinate seamlessly. During your consultation, we build a detailed timeline that ensures everyone is camera-ready right on schedule — no one is left waiting, and the bride always goes last for maximum freshness.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we customize the services for our group?",
    a: "Absolutely — every event package is fully customizable, and that is one of the biggest advantages of working with us. You can mix and match blowouts, updos, full glam makeup, natural makeup, gel manicures, pedicures, express facials, lash applications, and more to fit your group's preferences and budget. Some guests might want the full works while others just want a blowout — we accommodate individual preferences within the group booking. We will work with you during the planning phase to build a service menu that makes sense for your event, your timeline, and your budget.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide services for men's events too?",
    a: "Yes, we absolutely do. We offer full men's grooming packages including fades, haircuts, beard trims, hot towel shaves, lineup and edge-up services, brow cleanups, and even men's manicures and pedicures. Bachelor parties, groomsmen prep sessions, corporate events with mixed-gender teams, and group grooming sessions are all popular bookings. Our barbers and grooming specialists are experienced with all hair types and textures, and they bring the full barbershop experience directly to your location.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about venues — do you work in hotels, offices, and homes?",
    a: "We work anywhere with electricity and a bit of space. We have done events in Manhattan penthouses, Brooklyn Airbnbs, Queens banquet halls, Bronx community centers, Staten Island homes, Midtown hotel suites, corporate offices on Park Avenue, rooftop terraces, parks, event venues, lofts, studios, and even backstage at concert venues. We bring all of our own equipment — professional chairs, mirrors, lighting, tools, products, sanitization supplies, and backup gear. All we need from you is access to power outlets and enough room for our team to set up stations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a minimum group size for event bookings?",
    a: "Our event pricing of $99 per hour with a 2-hour minimum kicks in for groups of 3 or more people. However, we are flexible and can accommodate smaller bookings as well — even a solo bridal glam session qualifies as an event booking with its own pricing structure. For larger groups of 10 or more, we offer custom packages that can bring the per-person cost down significantly. Contact us with your group size and we will put together a tailored quote that works for your budget.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the cancellation and rescheduling policy for events?",
    a: "We understand that plans change, especially in New York City. For events, we ask for at least 48 hours notice for cancellations or reschedules with no penalty. Cancellations within 48 hours may be subject to a partial fee, depending on the size of the booking and how many team members we have already scheduled. For weddings and large-scale events, we have a separate deposit and cancellation policy that we walk you through during your initial consultation. Our goal is always to be fair and flexible.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you charge travel fees for event bookings?",
    a: "No, we do not charge travel fees for event bookings anywhere within the five boroughs of New York City. Whether your event is in the Financial District, Astoria, Park Slope, Riverdale, or Tottenville, the price is the same. Our team travels to you with all equipment and supplies included in the quoted rate. There are no hidden surcharges, no fuel fees, no setup fees, and no surprise upcharges on the day of your event. The price we quote is the price you pay.",
  },
  {
    q: "What products and brands do you use?",
    a: "Our stylists and makeup artists use professional-grade products from top salon and beauty brands. For hair, we work with products from brands like Oribe, Bumble and bumble, Moroccanoil, and Redken. For makeup, our artists carry professional lines including MAC, NARS, Charlotte Tilbury, and Make Up For Ever. For nails, we use OPI, Essie, and CND. We can also accommodate special requests if you have a preferred brand or if anyone in your group has allergies or sensitivities — just let us know during the booking process.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does payment work for event bookings?",
    a: "For most events, we collect a deposit at the time of booking to secure your date and team. The remaining balance is due on the day of the event. We accept all major credit cards, Venmo, Zelle, and cash. For large events like weddings and corporate bookings, we can set up a custom payment schedule with milestone payments leading up to the event date. We provide a detailed invoice that breaks down every service and cost so there are no surprises. Gratuity is always appreciated but never required.",

The NYC Mobile Salon's bridal beauty team specializes in creating timeless, camera-ready looks that hold up through every emotional moment, every hug, and every hour on the dance floor. We come to your hotel suite, your home, your Airbnb, or your venue with a full team of licensed hair stylists and makeup artists who work in parallel so your entire bridal party is ready exactly when they need to be.",
    "What makes mobile bridal beauty different from booking a salon? Everything. When you go the traditional route, you are coordinating transportation for multiple people to a salon at the crack of dawn, then rushing back to the venue for photos. With us, everyone gets ready together in one space. The photographer captures the getting-ready moments. The champagne flows. The energy builds naturally. And nobody has to sit in traffic with a fresh updo worrying about humidity. We handle all the logistics — timeline, team coordination, setup, products, tools, and cleanup — so you can focus on enjoying the morning of the biggest day of your life.",
    "We offer everything from solo bridal glam packages to full bridal party hair and makeup for groups of 15 or more. Our bridal trial runs ensure zero surprises on the wedding day.

    "Our party packages are fully customizable because no two celebrations are alike. Some groups want full glam — blowouts, updos, full-face makeup, gel manicures, lash applications — while others want something more relaxed, like express facials, simple blowouts, and classic manicures. You build the menu, we build the team. Multiple professionals work simultaneously so even a group of 15 can be fully glammed up in a couple of hours. We bring all the tools, products, stations, mirrors, and lighting. You bring the music and the guest list.",
    "Our most popular party bookings include birthday glam parties, bachelorette pampering sessions, prom prep parties, and spa days at home.

Popular corporate services include express manicures, brow cleanups, blowout touch-ups, hand massages, and mini facials.",
    "We have provided on-site beauty services for companies across every industry in New York City — from tech startups in Flatiron to law firms in Midtown, media companies in Hudson Yards to financial firms in the Financial District. Our corporate packages are designed for Employee Appreciation Day, Women's History Month, Mental Health Awareness initiatives, end-of-quarter celebrations, holiday parties, and frankly, any regular day when your team could use a morale boost. We handle all scheduling, setup, and cleanup, and we can brand the experience with custom signage for sponsor activations or company events.",
    "Beyond office wellness days, we offer headshot and photo shoot styling for team websites and LinkedIn profiles, conference touch-up stations for trade shows and networking events, and employee appreciation glam sessions.

We bring professional kits stocked with everything from natural beauty looks to full editorial glam, and our artists are experienced with HD, 4K, and high-contrast lighting requirements.",
    "For content creators, influencers, YouTubers, podcasters, and social media professionals, we offer dedicated packages designed for fast, camera-ready results. Our stylists understand how different platforms affect how makeup reads on camera, and they can pivot between multiple looks for different content pieces in a single session.

              The NYC Mobile Salon specializes in group and event beauty services across all five boroughs of New York City. Whether you are planning a <Link href="/events/bridal-hair-and-makeup" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">wedding</Link>, a <Link href="/events/birthday-glam-party" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">birthday party</Link>, a <Link href="/events/office-wellness-day" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">corporate wellness day</Link>, a <Link href="/events/on-set-hair-and-makeup" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">film or photo shoot</Link>, or a <Link href="/events/senior-home-salon-day" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">community outreach event</Link>, we send a full team of licensed hair stylists, makeup artists, nail technicians, and estheticians directly to your location with all of the equipment, products, and supplies needed to make every person in your group look and feel incredible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our event beauty services span five major categories: bridal, parties and celebrations, corporate and professional, film and photo production, and community and specialty events. Within those five categories, we offer 23 distinct event types — each with its own dedicated service menu, staffing approach, and pricing structure. From a solo bride getting glammed up in her hotel suite to a 200-person corporate wellness day in a Midtown office tower, we have the team, the experience, and the logistics to handle events of any size and complexity anywhere in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.
            </p>
            <p>
              What sets mobile event beauty apart from the traditional salon approach? When you coordinate a group at a salon, you are dealing with individual appointments spread across different time slots, transportation logistics, and the stress of getting everyone to the same place on time. With The NYC Mobile Salon, everyone gets ready together in one location. Our team arrives with professional stations, lighting, mirrors, and a full inventory of products. Multiple professionals work simultaneously so a group of 10 does not take 10 hours. The getting-ready experience becomes part of the event itself — relaxed, communal, and fun rather than a logistical headache.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our event pricing starts at $99 per hour with a 2-hour minimum for groups of 3 or more people. There are no travel fees anywhere in the five boroughs, no setup charges, and no surprise upcharges on the day of your event. For larger events and weddings, we offer custom packages with per-person pricing that can bring the cost down significantly. Every event starts with a free consultation where we learn about your vision, your group size, your timeline, and your budget, and we put together a tailored proposal that covers every detail. Visit our <Link href="/pricing" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">pricing page</Link> for more information on rates and packages.
            </p>
            <p>
              We handle everything from start to finish — initial consultation, team staffing, timeline planning, day-of coordination, setup, service delivery, and cleanup. You tell us what you need, how many people, when, and where, and we take care of the rest. Our event coordinators work with you to build a minute-by-minute schedule that ensures everyone is ready exactly when they need to be, whether that means the bride is camera-ready before the photographer arrives at 10am or the entire corporate team has fresh headshot styling before the shoot at 2pm. That level of planning and precision is what makes The NYC Mobile Salon the top choice for event beauty services in New York City.

            Why mobile event beauty is better than going to a salon
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            <p>
              Coordinating a group of people at a traditional salon is one of the most stressful parts of planning any event. You are juggling multiple appointment times, hoping everyone shows up on time, dealing with transportation across the city, and praying that the salon can accommodate your entire group without running behind schedule. By the time everyone is done, half the group has been waiting for hours and the energy is flat. Mobile event beauty eliminates all of that friction. Your team arrives at the location where the event is happening — or wherever the group is staying — and everyone gets ready together in the same space, at the same time, surrounded by the people they are celebrating with.
            </p>
            <p>
              The getting-ready experience is often one of the most memorable parts of any event, especially weddings, birthdays, and bachelorette weekends. When everyone is in the same room getting pampered simultaneously, the energy is completely different than a scattered morning of individual salon visits. The music is playing, the conversation is flowing, and the anticipation builds naturally as each person's look comes together. Our photographers and videographers love it too — the getting-ready photos and footage are some of the most candid, joyful content from any event. That communal experience simply does not happen when people are getting ready in isolation at different salons across the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a logistics standpoint, mobile event beauty is simply more efficient. We bring the exact number of professionals your group needs, and they all work simultaneously. A bridal party of 8 does not take 8 hours — it takes 2-3 hours with a team of 3-4 stylists working in parallel. We build a minute-by-minute timeline during the planning phase so every person knows exactly when they are in the chair, and the entire group is ready with time to spare before the next phase of the event begins. There is no waiting, no rushing, and no last-minute panic. We have done this hundreds of times and our coordination is dialed in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flexibility is another major advantage. We work in any space with electricity — apartments, hotel suites, Airbnbs, offices, event venues, backyards, rooftops, lofts, community centers, even parks. We bring all of our own equipment including professional chairs, mirrors, lighting rigs, product stations, and sanitization supplies. You do not need to arrange anything special or prepare the space in advance beyond making sure we have access and outlets. And because we come to you, there is no travel time eating into your schedule. The moment we arrive, we start setting up, and within minutes your group is getting pampered. That kind of flexibility and efficiency is why event planners, wedding coordinators, and corporate HR teams across New York City choose The NYC Mobile Salon over traditional salon bookings for their events.

            <p>
              Our event beauty services start at <strong className="text-charcoal">$99 per hour</strong> with a <strong className="text-charcoal">2-hour minimum</strong> for groups of 3 or more people. That rate covers the professional's time, all tools and products, travel to your location anywhere in the five boroughs, setup, and cleanup. There are no travel fees, no setup fees, no hidden surcharges, and no surprise upcharges on the day of your event. The price we quote during your consultation is the price you pay.
            </p>
            <p>
              For larger events — weddings with full bridal parties, corporate wellness days with 50+ employees, multi-day production shoots — we offer custom packages with per-person pricing, day rates, and volume discounts that can bring the overall cost down significantly. Every custom package is built specifically for your event based on your group size, the services requested, the timeline, and the complexity of the booking. Our event coordinators work with you to find the right balance between comprehensive service and budget.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specialty events like bridal glam, on-set production work, red carpet prep, and editorial styling have their own pricing tiers that reflect the advanced skill level and specialized products required. You can browse individual event pages for starting prices, or <Link href="/pricing" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">visit our pricing page</Link> for a full breakdown of rates across all services. For the fastest and most accurate quote, <Link href="/book" className="text-blush-dark hover:underline">submit an event inquiry</Link> with your details and we will have a custom proposal in your inbox within 24 hours.
