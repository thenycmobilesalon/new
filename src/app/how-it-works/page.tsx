  { q: "How far in advance should I book?", a: "We can often accommodate same-day requests, but 24-48 hours notice is ideal. For events, bridal parties, and group bookings, we recommend booking at least 1-2 weeks ahead to guarantee your preferred date and stylist." },
  { q: "What if I need to reschedule?", a: "No worries — reschedule for free up to 12 hours before your appointment. Life happens, and we get that. If you need to cancel entirely, the same 12-hour window applies. No penalties, no hassle." },
  { q: "Do I need to provide anything?", a: "Nope. Our stylists bring everything — tools, products, supplies, even a drop cloth to protect your floors. All you need is a chair, an outlet, and decent lighting. For skincare and makeup, come with clean skin." },
  { q: "Is there a travel fee?", a: "Travel is included for all 5 NYC boroughs — Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. No hidden charges, no surge pricing. The price you see is the price you pay." },
  { q: "What services do you offer?", a: "We offer 37+ services across hair, nails, makeup, skincare, waxing, and men's grooming. Everything from blowouts and braids to gel manicures, full glam makeup, facials, and beard trims. We also do events, bridal parties, corporate wellness days, and hands-on beauty classes." },
  { q: "Are your stylists licensed?", a: "Every single stylist, nail tech, esthetician, and barber on our team is fully licensed in the state of New York. We verify credentials, check references, and only work with experienced professionals. Your safety and results are non-negotiable." },
  { q: "How much does it cost?", a: "Services start at $99 per hour with a 1-hour minimum for individual appointments. Group bookings, events, and classes have a 2-hour minimum for groups of 3 or more. No hidden fees — pricing is transparent and all-inclusive." },
  { q: "Can I request a specific stylist?", a: "Absolutely. Once you've worked with someone you love, you can request them by name for future bookings. We'll do our best to accommodate your preference based on their availability." },
  { q: "What areas do you serve?", a: "We serve all five NYC boroughs — over 200 neighborhoods from the Upper East Side to Bay Ridge, Astoria to Riverdale, and everywhere in between. If you're in NYC, we come to you." },
  { q: "What about group bookings and events?", a: "We handle everything from bridal parties and bachelorettes to corporate team events and birthday celebrations. For groups of 3 or more, we assign multiple stylists so everyone gets attention. Contact us for custom event packages." },

              The NYC Mobile Salon makes booking mobile beauty services as simple as ordering dinner. We&apos;ve eliminated the friction that makes traditional salon experiences frustrating — the commute, the wait, the awkward small talk, the scramble to find parking. Instead, you get a licensed professional at your door, on your schedule, with everything they need to deliver salon-quality results in your own space.

            Why New Yorkers are switching to mobile beauty
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            <p>
              The traditional salon model was designed for a world where people had time to spare. You block out half your Saturday, commute to the salon, wait 20 minutes past your appointment time, sit in a chair for an hour, then commute back. That&apos;s 2-3 hours of your day gone for a service that takes 45 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mobile beauty flips that model. Your stylist comes to you — your apartment, your office, your hotel room, your Airbnb, your friend&apos;s living room. You save the commute time, the wait time, and the awkward &quot;am I done yet?&quot; energy. You can multitask, relax in your own space, or prep for your event in the same location where you&apos;re getting ready. For group bookings and events, it&apos;s even more efficient — everyone gets serviced in the same location instead of coordinating 8 people at a salon.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the quality? It&apos;s identical. Our professionals are the same licensed stylists, nail techs, makeup artists, and barbers who work at top NYC salons. The only difference is they come to you. Same tools, same products, same expertise — just way more convenient.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-charcoal">
              Over 5,000 New Yorkers have booked with The NYC Mobile Salon. The average rating is 4.9 out of 5. Once you try mobile beauty, you don&apos;t go back.
