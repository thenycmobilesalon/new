  { name: "Danielle R.", borough: "Manhattan", neighborhood: "Upper East Side", service: "Blowout", text: "I booked a blowout for a work event and my stylist arrived right on time to my UES apartment. She set up quickly, asked about my preferences, and gave me the bounciest, most voluminous blowout I have ever had. Three coworkers asked who did my hair that night.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Tamika J.", borough: "Brooklyn", neighborhood: "Crown Heights", service: "Silk Press", text: "Finding a stylist who understands natural hair texture is everything. My silk press came out bone straight, shiny, and lasted almost two weeks. She used a heat protectant and took her time with each section. I have already rebooked for next month.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Rachel L.", borough: "Manhattan", neighborhood: "Chelsea", service: "Balayage", text: "I was nervous about getting color done outside a salon, but my colorist brought everything she needed and the balayage came out absolutely gorgeous. The transition from my dark roots to the honey blonde ends is seamless. I get compliments daily.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Keisha W.", borough: "Brooklyn", neighborhood: "Bed-Stuy", service: "Braids", text: "She did my knotless braids in my living room while I watched Netflix. They are neat, even, and exactly the right tension. No sore scalp, no loose edges. Took about four hours for waist-length and worth every minute. Will never go back to sitting in a braiding shop.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Sofia C.", borough: "Queens", neighborhood: "Astoria", service: "Haircut", text: "My stylist gave me the most precise layered cut I have had in years.

  // Nails
  { name: "Aisha K.", borough: "Brooklyn", neighborhood: "Park Slope", service: "Gel Manicure", text: "I have two small kids and getting to a nail salon is basically impossible.

  { name: "Mei L.", borough: "Queens", neighborhood: "Flushing", service: "Nail Art", text: "I showed her a photo of a complex nail art design I found online and she recreated it perfectly.

  { name: "Christina V.", borough: "Staten Island", neighborhood: "Todt Hill", service: "Pedicure", text: "I booked a gel pedicure for me and my mom as a Mother's Day treat.

  { name: "Jasmine P.", borough: "Manhattan", neighborhood: "Harlem", service: "Dip Powder", text: "First time trying dip powder nails and I am completely converted.

  // Makeup
  { name: "Lauren D.", borough: "Manhattan", neighborhood: "Tribeca", service: "Bridal Makeup", text: "My wedding makeup artist arrived at my Tribeca loft at 6 AM, set up her station, and made me feel like a supermodel.

  { name: "Vanessa M.", borough: "Brooklyn", neighborhood: "Williamsburg", service: "Event Makeup", text: "Booked makeup for a gallery opening in Williamsburg and my artist nailed the brief perfectly.

  // Men's Grooming
  { name: "Marcus T.", borough: "Brooklyn", neighborhood: "Fort Greene", service: "Fade", text: "Best fade I have ever gotten and I did not even have to leave my couch.

  { name: "David K.", borough: "Manhattan", neighborhood: "Murray Hill", service: "Hot Towel Shave", text: "I treated myself to the hot towel straight razor shave before a big date. The barber was meticulous. Hot towel, pre-shave oil, three passes with a straight razor, cold towel, aftershave balm. My face has never been this smooth. I felt like I stepped out of a 1920s barbershop.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "James O.", borough: "Bronx", neighborhood: "Riverdale", service: "Beard Trim", text: "I have a long beard and most barbers do not know how to shape it properly. This guy clearly knew what he was doing. He trimmed it with scissors first, shaped the neckline with a trimmer, and finished with beard oil. Clean, professional, and fast.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Andre W.", borough: "Brooklyn", neighborhood: "Bushwick", service: "Men's Haircut", text: "Getting a barber to come to my Bushwick loft on a Sunday morning felt like a luxury I did not know I needed.

  // Classes
  { name: "Monica H.", borough: "Manhattan", neighborhood: "West Village", service: "Braiding Class", text: "I took the braiding basics class with five of my friends in my West Village apartment.

Such a fun girls' night activity.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Gabrielle T.", borough: "Queens", neighborhood: "Long Island City", service: "Makeup Class", text: "The everyday makeup masterclass was exactly what I needed.

  { name: "Patricia N.", borough: "Staten Island", neighborhood: "St. George", service: "Blowout", text: "Living in Staten Island, it always felt like good beauty services required a trip into Manhattan.

  { name: "Denise A.", borough: "Bronx", neighborhood: "Pelham Bay", service: "Deep Conditioning", text: "My hair was so damaged from years of heat styling. The stylist who came to my Pelham Bay apartment did a deep conditioning treatment with a protein mask and steam cap. My curls came back to life. She also gave me a whole at-home care plan. So thoughtful and knowledgeable.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Linda C.", borough: "Staten Island", neighborhood: "Great Kills", service: "Facial", text: "I booked an express facial and it was the most relaxing forty-five minutes of my week. The esthetician set up in my dining room with soft music and proper lighting. She analyzed my skin, did extractions gently, and my face was glowing afterward. Better than any spa I have been to.", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Michelle R.", borough: "Bronx", neighborhood: "Fordham", service: "Waxing", text: "I was nervous about getting a Brazilian at home but the esthetician was so professional and put me completely at ease.

              What makes us different is our commitment to consistency. Every professional on our roster is fully licensed and insured in New York State. They go through a multi-step vetting process that includes portfolio review, a live skills assessment, reference checks, and a background screening. We monitor quality continuously through post-appointment ratings, and any professional who falls below our standards is removed from the platform. That is how we maintain a 4.9 rating at scale — not by cherry-picking reviews, but by holding every appointment to the same high standard.

              Maintaining a 4.9 average rating across thousands of appointments does not happen by accident. It is the result of deliberate, systematic quality control at every stage of our operation. It starts with recruitment: we accept fewer than fifteen percent of professionals who apply to join our roster. Every candidate must hold a current New York State license in their specialty, provide a professional portfolio, pass a live skills assessment with one of our senior evaluators, and clear a comprehensive background check. We do not cut corners on vetting because our clients are inviting these professionals into their most personal spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once a professional joins our team, the quality monitoring continues. After every appointment, clients receive a brief survey asking them to rate their experience on a five-point scale across multiple dimensions: punctuality, professionalism, technique, cleanliness, and overall satisfaction. These ratings feed into each professional's running score, and we review performance data monthly. Professionals who maintain consistently high ratings earn priority scheduling and access to premium bookings. Those who receive negative feedback are contacted immediately, and repeated issues result in removal from the platform. We also conduct periodic unannounced quality checks and offer ongoing training workshops to keep our team at the top of their game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond individual performance, we invest heavily in the client experience as a whole. Our booking process is designed to be simple and transparent. Our <Link href="/pricing" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">pricing</Link> is all-inclusive with no hidden fees. Our customer support team is available seven days a week to handle questions, changes, and any concerns. And our satisfaction guarantee means that if something is not right, we make it right — no questions asked. We believe that every client deserves a five-star experience, and we build our entire business around delivering exactly that.
