Just let us know what you need when you book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer bridal hair and makeup services?",
    a: "Yes. Bridal services are one of our specialties.

We have specialists in silk press for natural hair (type 3 and 4 textures), braids and protective styles, extensions for all hair types, and color services for every shade and texture. When you book, let us know your hair type so we can match you with the right stylist.",
  },
  {
    q: "What products do your professionals use?",
    a: "Our professionals use salon-grade, professional products from trusted brands. For hair, that includes tools like professional dryers, flat irons, and curling wands, plus products with heat protectant and finishing serums. For nails, we use OPI, Essie, CND Shellac, and Gelish gel polishes. For makeup, our artists carry MAC, NARS, Charlotte Tilbury, and Make Up For Ever. For skincare, our estheticians use professional-grade cleansers, serums, masks, and SPF customized to your skin type.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book for a group of friends or a party?",
    a: "Yes. Group bookings are one of our most popular offerings. Whether it\u2019s a bridal party, bachelorette, birthday celebration, baby shower, girls\u2019 night in, or prom prep, we bring a full team to your location. For groups of three or more, there is a two-hour minimum at $99 per hour. We can accommodate groups of any size \u2014 just tell us how many people and what services you need.",

    a: "We serve all five boroughs of New York City \u2014 Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.

    "Hair services are the cornerstone of our women\u2019s beauty menu, and for good reason. Whether you are preparing for a major life event like a wedding or simply want to look and feel your best on a Tuesday afternoon, our licensed hairstylists deliver salon-quality results in the comfort of your own space. Every stylist arrives with professional-grade tools, premium products, and the expertise to work with your unique hair type, texture, and personal style. From a quick blowout before a dinner reservation to a full color transformation that takes hours of careful work, we handle it all.",
    "Our hair services span the full range of what you would find at any top-tier NYC salon. We offer blowouts and styling for every occasion, precision haircuts and trims tailored to your face shape and lifestyle, single-process and double-process color for everything from root touch-ups to platinum transformations, highlights and balayage for natural-looking dimension, deep conditioning treatments to restore damaged or dry hair, silk press for natural hair, braids and protective styles including box braids and cornrows, hair extension installation and removal, and elegant updos for weddings and formal events. Every service starts at $99 per hour.",
    "What sets our mobile hair services apart is the personalized attention you receive. In a busy NYC salon, you might see three different people during a single appointment. With us, one dedicated stylist handles your service from start to finish. They consult with you before picking up a single tool, they customize every step to your preferences, and they are not rushing to get to the next client in the chair. The result is better communication, better results, and a far more relaxing experience. Browse our full hair menu below and book your appointment today.",
  ],
  nails: [
    "Our mobile nail services bring the full nail salon experience to your door \u2014 minus the commute, the wait, and the questionable ventilation. Every nail technician arrives with a portable station, professional-grade tools, a full range of polish colors, UV and LED lamps for gel services, and hospital-grade sanitation supplies. Whether you want a quick classic manicure with OPI polish or an elaborate set of custom nail art over acrylics, our techs deliver flawless results at your kitchen table, your couch, or wherever you are most comfortable.",
    "We offer seven distinct nail services designed to cover every preference and occasion. Our classic manicure is perfect for a quick, polished finish. The gel manicure delivers chip-free, glossy nails that last two to three weeks. Classic and gel pedicures keep your feet looking and feeling their best with soaks, scrubs, callus removal, and massage included. Our nail art service is for anyone who wants custom, hand-painted designs \u2014 bring a Pinterest board or describe your vision and our artists will bring it to life. Acrylic and press-on application gives you length and strength in any shape you want, and dip powder provides a lightweight, durable alternative to both gel and acrylic. Prices start at $45 for a classic manicure and $65 for a gel manicure.",
    "One of the biggest advantages of mobile nail services is the ability to combine them with other treatments in a single appointment. Many of our clients book a gel manicure alongside a blowout, or add a pedicure to a facial appointment. You can mix and match any services on our menu, and for groups of three or more, you can turn it into a full pampering session with a two-hour minimum. No more running from the nail salon to the hair salon to the waxing studio \u2014 we bring everything to one location.",
  ],
  makeup: [
    "Our mobile makeup services are designed for anyone who wants to look camera-ready without sitting in a makeup chair at a busy studio. Our licensed makeup artists arrive at your door with professional kits stocked with products from MAC, NARS, Charlotte Tilbury, Make Up For Ever, and other top brands. They bring brushes, sponges, lashes, primers, setting sprays, and everything needed to create any look you envision, from a soft natural finish for a professional headshot to full glam for a wedding or gala.",
    "We offer three makeup services to cover the full spectrum of looks. Our full glam makeup is the signature service \u2014 perfect for weddings, galas, photo shoots, content creation, nights out, and any occasion where you want to look absolutely stunning. It includes skin prep, primer, full-coverage foundation, concealer, contour, highlight, eye makeup, lashes (strip or individual), and lip, all finished with setting spray for all-day wear. Our natural everyday makeup service is for clients who want a polished, enhanced look without the heavy coverage \u2014 great for professional headshots, first dates, brunches, and everyday confidence. And our lash application service offers standalone strip or individual lash application for instant drama in under 30 minutes.",
    "Makeup is also one of our most popular services for events. Bridal parties, bachelorette weekends, birthday celebrations, prom groups, and corporate headshot sessions all benefit from having a professional makeup artist come directly to the location. We can send multiple artists for larger groups to ensure everyone is ready on time. If you are planning an event, check out our events page for details on group bookings and packages.",
  ],
  skin: [
    "Professional skincare should not require a trip to a spa with a three-week waitlist. Our mobile skincare services bring licensed estheticians directly to your home, equipped with portable steamers, professional-grade products, and the training to address every skin concern from acne and hyperpigmentation to fine lines and dehydration. Every facial begins with a thorough skin assessment so your esthetician can customize the treatment to your specific skin type, condition, and goals.",
    "We offer four skincare services that range from quick maintenance to advanced treatment. The express facial is a 30-minute cleanse-tone-glow session perfect for busy schedules or pre-event skin prep. Our deep cleansing facial is a full 60-minute treatment with double cleansing, exfoliation, steam, extractions, a custom mask, serum, moisturizer, and SPF. Microdermabrasion uses professional-grade diamond-tip devices to exfoliate dead skin cells and promote cell turnover, ideal for dull skin, uneven texture, and mild scarring. And our light chemical peel uses glycolic, lactic, or salicylic acid to gently resurface the skin for a brighter, smoother complexion with minimal downtime.",
    "Skincare is deeply personal, and that is exactly why a mobile service makes so much sense. In your own bathroom, your esthetician has access to warm water, good lighting, and the privacy you need to fully relax and enjoy the treatment. There is no rushing to get dressed and back into the city after your facial \u2014 you can simply continue with your day (or go straight to bed with fresh, glowing skin). Our skincare services also pair beautifully with other services on our menu, so you can book a facial before a blowout and makeup application for the ultimate pre-event experience.",
  ],
  waxing: [
    "Our mobile waxing services offer professional hair removal in the comfort and privacy of your own home. Every waxing specialist is fully licensed and arrives with professional hard wax (which is gentler on the skin than strip wax for sensitive areas), disposable supplies, sanitation products, and soothing post-wax treatments. Privacy is especially important for intimate waxing services like bikini and Brazilian, and there is no more private setting than your own space.",
    "We offer six waxing services covering every area: brow wax and shaping for clean, sculpted arches that frame your face; lip and chin wax for quick facial hair removal; full face wax covering brows, upper lip, chin, and sideburns; bikini and Brazilian wax for clean lines or full removal; full leg and half leg wax for smooth, razor-burn-free legs; and underarm wax for results that last weeks longer than shaving. Prices range from $25 for a lip and chin wax to $120 for a full leg wax, and most services take 30 minutes or less.",
    "Waxing is also one of the easiest services to combine with other appointments. Many clients add a brow wax to a blowout or facial, or combine a Brazilian with a leg wax and underarm wax for a full body session. Results from professional waxing last three to six weeks depending on your hair growth cycle, making it far more effective and long-lasting than shaving. Our specialists also provide aftercare instructions to help you avoid ingrown hairs and irritation between appointments.",

            </h2>

              New York City women are among the busiest people on the planet. Between demanding careers, family responsibilities, social commitments, fitness routines, and the sheer logistics of navigating a city of eight million people, finding time for self-care can feel impossible. Traditional salons require commuting, waiting, and blocking out far more time than the service itself actually takes. A 45-minute blowout becomes a two-hour ordeal when you factor in the subway ride, the wait for your stylist, and the walk home. Mobile beauty eliminates all of that friction. Your stylist arrives at your door at the exact time you booked, performs the service, and you are done. No commute, no waiting room, no wasted time.
            </p>
            <p>
              For busy professionals, mobile beauty means you can get a blowout before a morning meeting without waking up at 5 AM, or have your nails done during your lunch break without leaving the office. For moms, it means getting your hair colored while the baby naps, or having a stylist come while the kids are at school instead of trying to find childcare for a salon visit. For brides, it means the entire bridal party can get ready together at the hotel or venue, creating memories and reducing the chaos of wedding-morning logistics. For anyone recovering from surgery, managing a disability, or simply preferring the comfort of home, mobile beauty brings professional services directly to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a quality advantage that many clients do not expect. In a traditional salon, your stylist is often juggling multiple clients at once, stepping away to check on someone else&apos;s color processing or fielding interruptions from the front desk. With a mobile appointment, your professional&apos;s entire focus is on you. The consultation is more thorough, the service is more attentive, and the results are consistently better because there are zero distractions. Every service at The NYC Mobile Salon starts at $99 per hour, and the quality of that hour is unmatched by anything you will experience in a traditional salon setting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, mobile beauty is simply more hygienic. Our professionals bring their own sanitized tools, single-use disposable items, and fresh products to every appointment. You are not sharing a nail station that has seen a dozen clients that day, or sitting in a styling chair with someone else&apos;s hair still on the cape. Your appointment happens in your own clean space, with tools that were sanitized specifically for you. For anyone who has ever been concerned about salon cleanliness &mdash; and especially since the pandemic raised everyone&apos;s awareness of shared spaces &mdash; mobile beauty offers peace of mind that brick-and-mortar salons simply cannot match.

              Some of the best moments in life are shared with the women closest to you, and The NYC Mobile Salon makes it easy to turn those moments into full-on pampering experiences. Our event services bring a team of licensed professionals directly to your home, hotel suite, Airbnb, venue, or any private space in New York City. Whether you are celebrating a wedding, a milestone birthday, a baby on the way, or simply a Saturday night with your best friends, we handle the beauty so you can focus on the celebration.

              <strong>Bridal parties</strong> are our most popular group booking. We offer <Link href="/events" className="text-blush-dark underline hover:text-blush">bridal hair and makeup</Link>, bridal party packages for bridesmaids and mothers, trial runs, and engagement or boudoir shoot styling. Our team arrives at your getting-ready location with everything needed to make every member of the bridal party look and feel incredible. For <strong>bachelorette weekends</strong>, we bring manicures, pedicures, blowouts, and makeup to your rental or hotel for a spa-like experience without leaving the party. <strong>Birthday celebrations</strong> get the same treatment &mdash; book nail art, glam makeup, and styling for the birthday crew. <strong>Baby showers</strong> are elevated with mini manicures and express facials for the guests while the mama-to-be gets pampered. And <strong>girls&apos; night in</strong> is taken to another level with a mix of mani-pedis, blowouts, and face masks (you supply the wine).
