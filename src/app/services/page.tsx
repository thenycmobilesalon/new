  {
    q: "What mobile beauty services do you offer in NYC?",
    a: "We offer 37+ mobile beauty services across 6 categories: women's hair (blowouts, haircuts, color, highlights, silk press, braids, extensions, updos), nails (classic and gel manicures, pedicures, nail art, acrylics, dip powder), makeup (full glam, natural everyday, lash application), skin care (express facials, deep cleansing facials, microdermabrasion, chemical peels), waxing (brows, lip, chin, bikini, Brazilian, legs, underarms), and a full men's grooming menu including fades, beard sculpting, hot towel shaves, and more. Every service is performed at your location by a licensed professional.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are your stylists and barbers licensed?",
    a: "Yes, every single professional on The NYC Mobile Salon team is fully licensed by the New York State Department of State Division of Licensing Services. Our hairstylists, colorists, nail technicians, estheticians, makeup artists, barbers, and waxing specialists all hold current, valid New York State cosmetology or specialty licenses. We verify credentials before anyone joins our team, and we require ongoing education to keep skills sharp and up to date.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do your mobile beauty services cost?",
    a: "Our services are priced at $99 per hour with a one-hour minimum for individual appointments. For groups of 3 or more people, there is a two-hour minimum. There are never any travel fees — whether you are in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, or Staten Island, the price is the same. All supplies, tools, and professional-grade products are included in the hourly rate. No hidden charges, no surprise add-ons.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book multiple services in one appointment?",
    a: "Absolutely. Many of our clients book combination appointments — for example, a blowout plus full glam makeup before an event, or a haircut, beard trim, and brow cleanup in a single session. Because we charge by the hour, you can stack as many services as you like. Your stylist or technician will estimate the total time needed so you know the cost up front. For groups, we can send multiple professionals to serve everyone simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you serve all five NYC boroughs?",
    a: "Yes, we serve every neighborhood in all five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. From the Upper East Side to Bushwick, from Astoria to Riverdale, from St. George to Flushing — we come to you. There are no travel fees regardless of your location within NYC. We serve homes, apartments, offices, hotels, event venues, and any private location.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer services for events like weddings and parties?",
    a: "Yes, events are one of our specialties. We offer bridal beauty packages, bridesmaid styling, bachelorette party glam, prom prep, birthday party services, corporate event grooming, photo shoot styling, holiday party looks, and more. Our event packages include on-site professionals who bring everything needed. We can serve large groups with multiple stylists, makeup artists, and nail techs working simultaneously. Visit our events page to learn more and book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer men's grooming services?",
    a: "Yes, we have a comprehensive men's grooming menu that includes haircuts and styling, precision fades (low, mid, high, skin, shadow, drop, burst, and temp fades), line-ups and edge-ups, buzz cuts, beard trims and sculpting, hot towel straight razor shaves, beard oil treatments, brow cleanup, ear and nose waxing, scalp treatments, men's manicures, men's pedicures, and back waxing. Every service is performed by a licensed barber or grooming specialist at your location.",
  },
  {
    q: "What products and tools do your professionals use?",
    a: "Our professionals use salon-grade and barbershop-grade products and tools. For hair, that includes professional dryers, flat irons, curling wands, clippers, trimmers, and shears, plus products from top brands. For nails, we use OPI, Essie, CND Shellac, and Gelish with portable UV/LED lamps. Makeup artists work with MAC, NARS, Charlotte Tilbury, and Make Up For Ever.

              Men&apos;s grooming has evolved far beyond a quick trim at the corner barbershop, and The NYC Mobile Salon is leading that evolution in New York City. Our <strong>men&apos;s grooming menu covers three categories — hair, beard, and body grooming</strong> — with over a dozen professional services designed for the modern man who values his appearance and his time. Every service is performed at your location by a licensed barber or grooming specialist with professional-grade tools.

              Hair services include classic and modern haircuts, precision fades in every style (low, mid, high, skin, shadow, drop, burst, and temp), crisp line-ups and edge-ups, and clean buzz cuts. Our beard menu features sculpted trims and shaping, old-school hot towel straight razor shaves, and hydrating beard oil treatments. The body grooming menu rounds things out with brow cleanup, ear and nose waxing, scalp treatments, men&apos;s manicures, men&apos;s pedicures, and back waxing. Whether you are a Wall Street executive, a creative professional in Williamsburg, or a dad in Park Slope who just needs 30 minutes to look sharp, we come to you — <strong>$99/hr, no travel fees, all boroughs</strong>.

                Skip the subway, skip the traffic, skip searching for a parking spot. Your stylist, barber, or nail tech comes directly to your home, office, or hotel room. You save time and energy — and you never have to sit in a salon waiting room again. In a city where the average commute eats 40 minutes each way, that time adds up fast.
