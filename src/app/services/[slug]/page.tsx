Every price includes travel to your door anywhere in the five boroughs, all professional tools and products, and a fully licensed professional. There are no hidden fees, no trip charges, and no surprise add-ons. You know exactly what you are paying before your appointment is confirmed.` : `Our pricing is $99 per hour with a one-hour minimum for individual clients. For groups of three or more, there is a two-hour minimum. Every price includes travel, tools, products, and a licensed professional. No hidden fees.` },
    { q: `How long does ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} take?`, a: content ? `${svc.name} typically takes ${content.duration}. Your professional will give you an exact estimate based on your specific needs during booking. Keep in mind that mobile appointments sometimes take a few extra minutes compared to a salon because we take the time to set up a proper workstation in your space. We always build in enough time so your appointment never feels rushed. If you are booking multiple services, we will give you a combined time estimate so you can plan your day accordingly.` : `Duration varies based on your specific needs. Contact us for an estimate. We always allow enough time for setup and a thorough, unhurried service.` },
    { q: `Do I need to provide anything for ${svc.name.toLowerCase()}?`, a: `Nothing at all. Your professional arrives with every tool, product, and supply needed to deliver a salon-quality ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} experience. All we ask is that you have a comfortable space with good lighting ready. For hair services, access to a sink is helpful but not always required. For nail services, a table and chair work perfectly. We bring protective coverings for your furniture and floors, and we clean up completely before we leave. You do not need to worry about a thing.` },
    { q: `Is your ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} professional licensed?`, a: `Absolutely. Every professional on our team is fully licensed by the New York State Department of State, carries personal liability insurance, and has been vetted through our multi-step screening process. We verify credentials, check references, and conduct in-person skill assessments before anyone joins our team. Many of our professionals have five or more years of experience working in top New York City salons and barbershops before joining our mobile team. Your safety, comfort, and results are our highest priorities.` },
    { q: `What's included in the price for ${svc.name.toLowerCase()}?`, a: `Every ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} appointment includes travel to your location anywhere in NYC's five boroughs, all professional-grade tools and equipment, premium products and supplies, a fully licensed and insured professional, setup and cleanup of a workstation in your space, and a consultation to ensure you get exactly what you want. There are no extra charges for travel, no fuel surcharges, and no hidden product fees. The price you are quoted is the price you pay. For groups of three or more, we offer a two-hour minimum at our standard $99 per hour rate.` },
    { q: `How do I prepare for my ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} appointment?`, a: `Preparing for your mobile ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} appointment is easy. Make sure you have a comfortable, well-lit area where your professional can work. For hair services, being near a sink is ideal but not mandatory. For nail services, a table and two chairs are all you need. For waxing and skin services, a bed or couch with a clean sheet works perfectly. We recommend wearing comfortable clothing that is easy to change if needed. Have any inspiration photos or references ready to share during your consultation. Beyond that, just relax and let us handle everything.` },
    { q: `Can I book ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} with other services?`, a: `Yes, and many of our clients do. Combining services is one of the biggest advantages of mobile beauty. You can book ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} alongside any of our other ${isWomens ? "women's" : "men's"} services in the same appointment. Popular combinations include hair and nails, hair and makeup, or a full grooming package. When you book multiple services, we coordinate timing so everything flows smoothly. You can also book for multiple people at the same location, which is perfect for bridal parties, girls' nights, or group events. Visit our <a href="/services">full services page</a> to see everything we offer.` },
    { q: `What products do you use for ${svc.name.toLowerCase()}?`, a: `We use only professional-grade, salon-quality products from trusted brands. Our professionals carry a curated selection of premium products chosen for performance, safety, and results. All products are appropriate for a wide range of skin types and hair textures. If you have allergies, sensitivities, or specific product preferences, let us know when you book and we will accommodate your needs. We never use cheap, drugstore-grade products. Your results should be indistinguishable from what you would get at the best salon in Manhattan.` },
    { q: `How do I reschedule or cancel my ${svc.name.toLowerCase()} appointment?`, a: `We understand that plans change, especially in New York City. You can reschedule or cancel your appointment with at least 24 hours notice at no charge. Simply text us, call us, or reply to your confirmation message. If you need to reschedule within 24 hours of your appointment, we will do our best to accommodate you, though a late cancellation fee may apply. We are flexible and understanding because we know how busy life in NYC can be. Our goal is to make the entire experience, from booking to completion, as stress-free as possible.` },

                  One of the biggest advantages of booking mobile {svc.name.toLowerCase()} is that you receive this service in the comfort and privacy of your own space. There is no rushing through traffic, no searching for parking near a crowded salon, and no sitting in a waiting room scrolling through your phone while your appointment runs behind schedule. When you book with The NYC Mobile Salon, your licensed professional arrives at your door at the scheduled time, sets up a clean and organized workstation, and gives you their complete, undivided attention for the entire appointment. The result is a more relaxed, more personalized, and ultimately better experience than what most traditional salons can offer.

We believe that great results start with great communication, and we never skip this step. Whether you have a specific look in mind, a photo to share, or you want expert guidance, your professional will walk you through the process, set expectations, and make sure you are completely comfortable before any work begins. Our professionals maintain the same exacting standards they upheld at top New York City salons and barbershops, and they bring those standards directly to your living room, bedroom, office, or hotel room.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Our team follows strict hygiene and sanitation protocols that meet or exceed New York State requirements. All tools are sanitized between clients using hospital-grade disinfectants, and single-use items are disposed of properly after every appointment. We carry liability insurance and maintain active New York State professional licenses.
