      q: `How much do mobile ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} professionals earn with The NYC Mobile Salon?`,
      a: `Our mobile ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} professionals earn $49 or more per hour. There are no booth rental fees, no product charges, and no overhead costs deducted from your earnings. Tips are 100% yours. Payment is sent via Zelle or Apple Cash within 30 minutes of job completion. On a full-time schedule of 30 to 40 hours per week, that translates to $1,470 to $1,960 in weekly earnings — significantly more than most traditional salon positions in New York City.`,
    },
    {
      q: `What license do I need to do mobile ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} work in NYC?`,
      a: `You must hold a valid New York State ${licenseType} license. We verify every license before onboarding and conduct periodic checks to ensure ongoing compliance. If your license is pending renewal, you may still apply — but you cannot begin accepting bookings until your license is current and verified.`,
    },
    {
      q: `Do I need to bring my own tools and products for mobile ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} appointments?`,
      a: `Yes. All professionals on our platform are expected to arrive at every appointment with their own professional-grade tools, products, and supplies. This includes everything specific to ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} services. You know your tools best, and your clients expect a fully professional setup from the moment you arrive.`,
    },
    {
      q: `How do I get ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} clients through The NYC Mobile Salon?`,
      a: `We handle all client acquisition through marketing, SEO, advertising, and partnerships. When a client in your service area books a ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} appointment, you receive a notification and can accept the booking. Our matching system prioritizes professionals based on location, availability, ratings, and expertise. You never have to hustle for your own clients — we fill your calendar.`,
    },
    {
      q: `Can I do mobile ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} work part-time while keeping my salon job?`,
      a: `Absolutely. Many of our ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} professionals use The NYC Mobile Salon to supplement their existing salon income. You set your own availability — work evenings, weekends, or specific days only. There are no minimum hour requirements. Some professionals start part-time and transition to full-time once they see how much more they earn without booth rent and overhead.`,
    },
    {
      q: `What boroughs and neighborhoods can I offer mobile ${serviceName.toLowerCase()} services in?`,
      a: `We serve all five NYC boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. During onboarding, you select the neighborhoods and boroughs where you are willing to travel. You can update your service area at any time. Most professionals choose neighborhoods close to where they live to minimize travel time between appointments.`,

              The NYC Mobile Salon is actively hiring licensed {service.name.toLowerCase()} professionals to join our growing team of mobile beauty experts serving clients across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. This is not a traditional salon job. You will not be sitting in a chair waiting for walk-ins or paying hundreds of dollars a week in booth rent. Instead, you will be traveling directly to clients — in their homes, offices, hotel rooms, and event venues — delivering the same high-quality {service.name.toLowerCase()} services you would in any top NYC salon, but with dramatically better pay, total schedule flexibility, and zero overhead costs.

            <p>
              A typical day as a mobile {service.name.toLowerCase()} professional might include two to five appointments across your chosen service area. You wake up, check your bookings for the day on our platform, pack your professional kit, and head to your first client. Each appointment is a one-on-one experience where you can focus entirely on your craft without the distractions and noise of a busy salon floor. Between appointments, you travel at your own pace — many of our professionals schedule gaps for lunch, errands, or simply to recharge. Your day ends when you decide it ends.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are looking for {service.name.toLowerCase()} professionals who take pride in their work, who treat every client like their most important one, and who want to build a sustainable, high-earning career in the beauty industry without sacrificing their personal life. Whether you are currently working in a salon and ready for something better, freelancing on your own and tired of hustling for every booking, or re-entering the industry after time away, The NYC Mobile Salon gives you the platform, the clients, and the support to succeed on your terms. Learn more about our <Link href={`/services/${slug}`} className={`${accentText} underline hover:no-underline`}>{service.name.toLowerCase()} services</Link> or explore all <Link href="/join" className={`${accentText} underline hover:no-underline`}>open positions</Link> on our team.

            <p>
              Mobile {service.name.toLowerCase()} jobs in NYC are in higher demand than ever. New Yorkers across all five boroughs are choosing the convenience and comfort of at-home beauty services, and that demand translates directly into consistent bookings and strong earnings for the professionals on our roster. If you have the skills, the license, and the drive, we have the clients and the infrastructure to keep your calendar full.
