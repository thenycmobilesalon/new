    q: "How much can I earn as a mobile beauty professional in NYC?",
    a: "We pay $49 per hour via Zelle or Apple Cash within 30 minutes of job completion — usually within 5 minutes of client payment. Part-time professionals working weekends typically earn $490 to $735 per week, while full-time pros working 30-40 hours take home $1,470 to $1,960. Event-heavy weeks can push earnings even higher. Because there are no booth rental fees or overhead costs, most professionals keep significantly more than they did in a traditional salon setting. Tips are additional and 100% yours.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get clients?",
    a: "We handle all marketing, advertising, search engine optimization, and client acquisition. When a client books a service in your area and specialty, you receive a notification and can accept the appointment. Our matching system prioritizes professionals based on location, availability, ratings, and expertise so that the right clients are always connected with the right pros.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the application process?",
    a: "The process is straightforward. Fill out the application form on this page with your name, specialty, availability, Instagram handle, and a short video selfie (minimum 30 seconds). You can also upload your resume. Our team will verify your New York State license, check references, and schedule a brief phone interview. Most applicants hear back within 48 hours, and the entire onboarding process typically takes less than one week.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need my own tools and products?",
    a: "Yes. All professionals on our platform are expected to bring their own professional-grade tools, equipment, and products to every appointment. This includes everything from shears and clippers to nail lamps and makeup kits. You know your tools best, and your clients expect a professional setup from the moment you arrive.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this full-time or part-time?",
    a: "That is entirely up to you. Many of our professionals work full-time and treat The NYC Mobile Salon as their primary source of income. Others use the platform to supplement an existing salon schedule or pick up extra clients on weekends. You set your own hours, your own availability, and your own service area — there are no minimum hour requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "What areas of New York City can I work in?",
    a: "We serve all five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. During onboarding, you select the neighborhoods and boroughs where you are willing to travel. You can update your service area at any time. Most professionals choose neighborhoods close to where they live so they can minimize travel time between appointments.",
  },
  {
    q: "How and when do I get paid?",
    a: "You get paid $49 per hour via Zelle or Apple Cash within 30 minutes of job completion — in most cases, payment hits within 5 minutes of the client paying. No waiting for Friday. No invoicing. No chasing clients. You finish the appointment, and the money is in your account before you get to your next booking. It is that fast.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide liability insurance?",
    a: "Yes. Every professional on our roster is covered by our comprehensive general liability insurance policy at no additional cost. This coverage protects you while you are performing services booked through The NYC Mobile Salon platform. We believe our team should be able to focus on their craft without worrying about costly insurance premiums.",

            <p>
              The mobile beauty industry is booming, and New York City is at the center of it. More clients than ever are choosing the convenience of having a licensed professional come to their home, office, hotel, or event venue instead of traveling to a traditional salon. At The NYC Mobile Salon, we have been at the forefront of this shift since day one — and the demand is growing faster than we can keep up.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is where you come in. We are actively looking for experienced, licensed beauty professionals across every specialty to join our growing roster. Whether you are a hairstylist who specializes in blowouts and color, a barber known for clean fades, a nail technician with an eye for detail, a makeup artist who can create any look from natural to editorial, or an esthetician delivering spa-quality facials in living rooms across the city — there is a place for you on our team.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are not a staffing agency and we are not a franchise. We are a modern beauty platform that connects New York City&rsquo;s best independent professionals with thousands of clients who are ready to book. We handle the marketing, the scheduling, the payment processing, and the customer service. You handle what you do best: making people look and feel incredible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our professionals earn more than they did in traditional salons because they keep a larger share of every appointment and pay zero booth rental fees. They work the hours they choose, in the boroughs they prefer, with the support of a team that genuinely cares about their success. If that sounds like the kind of career you have been looking for, keep reading.
