const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What does sweat equity actually mean here?",
    a: "You put in operational work and earn ownership over time against defined milestones — first hires made, first $X of monthly revenue hit, first month of operator-led growth, and so on. Specific equity percentages and vesting are discussed in the first call because they depend on your experience, the scope of what you take on, and the compensation structure that works for both sides. What is not negotiable is that the ownership is meaningful and the path to it is clear.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a W-2 job or a founder role?",
    a: "Founder / co-founder-level role. It is not a W-2 position and there is no salary or hourly pay during the ramp. The business is pre-revenue and bootstrapped — there is no outside capital to pay an operator today, and we are not pretending otherwise. The comp during ramp is the equity stake. As revenue comes in, a compensation structure builds on top of the equity — revenue-share, salary draw, and performance bonuses tied to milestones — all negotiated at the offer stage. If you need income from day one, this is the wrong fit and we both need to know that up front.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much capital does the business need before it can scale?",
    a: "Very little. The website, booking platform, SEO engine, and AI automation stack are already built and paid for. Payment processing, liability insurance, and the compliance stack are in place. The biggest marginal cost of scaling is the time spent hiring and onboarding licensed pros — and that is what you will be running. The business is designed to grow on gross margin, not venture capital.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is the founder hiring a CEO instead of running it themselves?",
    a: "The founder is an operator with 25 years of marketing, branding, business development, growth, and strategy experience. The brand, the SEO engine, the AI automation, the platform, and the early demand are already built. What is not the founder's highest and best use is the day-to-day operations of hiring dispatchers, managing cleaner rosters, and running CX — that is a different skill set, and it is a full-time job. The right operator takes this from a founder-led prototype to a real NYC business, and eventually to a multi-city platform.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does 'AI-driven automation backend' mean in practice?",
    a: "It means the grunt work of running a services marketplace is already mostly automated. Lead qualification, appointment confirmations, cleaner matching, customer service triage, and admin workflows are handled by in-house AI agents that have been built and deployed. As the operator, you are not reinventing these systems — you are using them as leverage. When you need a new automation, the dev capability is here to build it. That is what makes this different from stepping into a typical services startup where everything is manual.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to already live in NYC to apply?",
    a: "Strongly preferred. This is a New York City operation — the service area is the five boroughs, the first hires are NYC-based, and the customer relationships are in-person. If you are relocating to NYC in the near term, we are open to a conversation, but we are not hiring remote operators for this role. Once NYC is stable, national expansion is the next chapter.",
  },
  {
    q: "What platforms count as 'marketplace or on-demand services experience'?",
    a: "Any two-sided platform where you scaled supply (independent professionals) and demand (clients) simultaneously. That includes beauty-specific platforms like Glamsquad, Soothe, StyleSeat, Priv, BeGlammed, BeGLOSSY, and Blowtie, broader services marketplaces like Booksy, Vagaro, Urban Company, Handy, TaskRabbit, Zeel, and Rinse, and adjacent categories like fitness (Classpass), cleaning, or home services. If you scaled a supply-constrained services platform at any significant level — whether you ran ops, growth, or general management — we want to talk.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I do not have a marketplace background but I am a strong NYC operator?",
    a: "Apply anyway. The marketplace experience is strongly preferred because the unit economics, supply/demand dynamics, and operational playbook are specific to two-sided platforms. But if you have scaled an NYC services business, managed a P&L, and built a team — and you can articulate why you understand marketplace dynamics even without direct experience — we will read your application carefully. Tell us the story in the application.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the first 30 days look like?",
    a: "First week: full data access, 1:1 with the founder, and shadowing the inbound pipeline and cleaner onboarding. Second week: you write the 30/60/90 plan, propose the first three hires, and start closing the backlog of inbound leads. Third and fourth week: first operational hire onboarded, customer service playbook written, and first measurable revenue milestone set. The goal is for the business to be running on your operational playbook — not the founder's — by the end of month one.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know this is not just a cheap way to hire an operator for equity?",
    a: "Fair question. The honest answer is that the founder has built the business to the point where most of the 'build' work is done — brand, platform, SEO, automation, early demand. What is left is the operator work, and that is genuinely what the founder is not the best person to do. The equity is meaningful because the value creation from this point forward is operational, not technical or marketing-related. You will see the full data room in the second conversation and make your own judgment. If it is not compelling, walk away. This is designed to be obviously a good deal for the right person, and obviously not the right fit for everyone else.",

              Most operator roles ask you to either risk your own capital to buy in, or to join a company that is already ten years old and running on its own momentum. This role is different. <strong>The NYC Mobile Salon</strong> is 30 days old, pre-revenue, and pre-first-hire — and it already has a year&rsquo;s worth of SEO traction, a fully working booking platform, a custom AI-automated operational backend, and a backlog of inbound client demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is missing is the operator. The person who owns sales, operations, hiring, and customer service. The person who takes the business from founder-led to operator-led, builds the first real team, and scales NYC before the business goes national.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the platform and the automation are already in place, this role is about leverage — not grinding. The tech does the heavy lifting. The operator drives growth, closes the inbound, and builds the team. The brand, the SEO engine, the AI automation, and the early demand are already built. You are stepping into traction, not a blank page.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business was built by an operator with <strong>25 years of experience in marketing, branding, business development, growth, and strategy</strong>. That operator is not the right person to run day-to-day operations, hire dispatchers, or build the first CX team — and honestly, they know it. The right founding operator walks into the business, looks at what is already built, and says <em>&ldquo;I know exactly what to do with this.&rdquo;</em>

                Most early-stage services businesses spend the first two years manually doing the work that eventually gets automated. We did it in reverse — we built the automation first. Lead triage, appointment confirmations, cleaner matching, admin workflows, and customer service routing are already automated. You walk into leverage. Your time is spent on the work that only a human can do — closing deals, building trust, and hiring the right people.

                21,100 pages indexed. 11,500 impressions in 30 days. Average position 12.2 on a brand-new domain.

Your job is to make sure someone is.
